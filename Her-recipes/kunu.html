   <p>prep time:8-11 hrs <br>cook time:90 mins<br></p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>4 cups millet</li>
   <li>  1/2 cup sugar</li>
   <li> 2 cups germinated rice</li>
   <li> 1 teaspoon cloves</li>
   <li>3 dry ginger</li>
   <li>  3 large fresh potatoes (or dry potatoes)</li>
   <li>  1 cup milk (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>In a bowl, soak the millet in water for 10 hours or overnight. In a separate bowl, soak the germinated rice in water for 8-10 hours. If you are using dried potatoes, soak them together with the rice. (If you are using fresh potatoes, do not soak them.) If the weather is hot, you can soak for just 8 hours; the heat will help soften the millet and rice.</li>
<li>After 8-10 hours, wash the millet and grind it into a fine paste.</li>
<li>Wash the germinated rice and put it in a bowl. Wash the ginger, potatoes, and cloves, and grind them together with the rice.</li>
<li>Scoop out one cup of the ground millet.</li>
<li>Add boiling water to the millet bowl, just as you would when making pap or starch. Allow it to cool.</li>
<li>When it has cooled completely, add back in the 1 cup millet. Also, add the rice, ginger, potatoes, and clove mixture. Stir with a large spoon or wooden spatula.</li>
<li>Use a fine cloth to sift the mixture. Throw away the chaff.</li>
<li>If you are adding the optional milk, add it now and stir. Refrigerate immediately to prevent fermentation. Refrigeration preserves its fresh taste.</li>
<li>serve after refrigerating.</li>
</ol>
