 <h4>Making the African Salad</h4>


<p><i>The key to making a good African Salad is to make sure that all the ingredients are well incorporated. As you will see below, there's a lot of add this, stir, add that, stir. You may wonder why you can't just add everything and stir but if you do that, it will be very difficult for you to get a good blend of all the ingredients.</i></p>
<ol>
   <li>Pour the palm oil into a sizeable pot. Yes you need all that oil so that your Abacha will not have a dry feel in the mouth when done. Pour the water from the potash mixture, making sure not to pour the sediments.</li>
   <li>Stir very well and you'll see the oil turn into a yellow paste.</li>
   <li>Add the ground pepper, ground ehu, crushed stock cubes, crayfish, diced onions and ugba (ukpaka), then stir very well. Please not that we are doing everything off the stove.</li>
   <li>Add the iru/ogiri and make sure it is mixed very well. Add the diced kanda/pomo and stir very well.</li>
   <li>Now add the soaked and drained Abacha and stir till it is well-incorporated in the palm oil paste.</li>
   <li>Add the sliced Utazi and salt to taste and stir well. You can also use dry Utazi if the fresh one is not available where you live. It is important that you add salt last because after adding all that seasoning, your Abacha may not even need salt any more.</li>
   <li>I like my Abacha warm. If you like yours that way too, transfer to a stove at this point and heat it up to your desired temperature at medium heat. When done, turn off the heat and add the sliced garden egg leaves, stir very well and serve.</li>
   <li>If you like your Abacha cold, after step 6, add the sliced garden egg leaves, stir and serve with garden eggs, fish and onions.</li>
</ol>
