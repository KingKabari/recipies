    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

    <li>5 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
    <li>2 red onion</li>
    <li>2 thumb-size fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 sachet tomato paste </li>
    <li>0.5 cup  oil (any kind would do)</li>
    <li>2 cup long-grain rice (Washed)</li>
    <li>3 tbsp curry powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
    <li>4 bay leaf</li>
    <li>3 tsp salt</li>
    <li>season cubes to taste </li>
    </ul>
   <h4> INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
 <ol>
   <li>Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.</li>
   <li>Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the  oil, tomato paste and add the blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
   <li>After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and seasonings (thyme,curry, bay leaf,seasoning cubes and salt). Stir altogether.</li>
   <li>Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.</li>
   <li>Place a piece of aluminium foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).</li>
   <li>Remove lid, bin the aluminium foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
   <li>Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favourite sides and enjoy!</li>
