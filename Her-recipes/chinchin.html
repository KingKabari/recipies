    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li> 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
    <li>   1/4 teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
    <li>   1 egg large</li>
    <li>    5 to 6 Tbsp liquid Milk</li>
    <li>   2 1/2 Tbsp Butter melted</li>
    <li>   vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>   1/2 tsp cinnamon or nutmeg</li>       
    </ul>
  <ul> 
    <em><b>note:</b>
        <li>if you are using powdered milk ;just dissolve 2 Tbs of powder milk in 8Tbsp of water then use the required amount in the recipe (6 to 7 Tbsp) and drink the rest!</li>
        <li> If you want the super-soft chin chin with little to no crunch then add 1 extra tablespoon of butter and an extra 1/4 tsp of baking powder</li>
        <li> If you are a fan of the super hard chin chin leave out the Egg and the baking powder; at this point, your dough will be hard but if you find it too hard to work then add about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of milk to make it workable.</li>
    </em>
</ul>
    <h4>How to check if the oil is hot enough for frying</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>If the dough stays at the bottom for a long time, then the oil needs to be heated up a little more.</li>
    <li>If the dough rises too rapidly, then you may need to turn down the heat a little bit; otherwise, the chin chi will brown too quickly.</li>
    <li>If the dough gradually floats to the surface of the oil, then the oil is just right.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
   <li>Mix the Flour, baking powder, Sugar, and Nutmeg together in a Bowl</li>
   <li>Add the Egg, Melted Butter and Milk to the dry mixture and mix together until a dough is formed and knead the dough for a couple of minutes (about 2 to 4 minutes)</li>
   <li>Roll the dough it out into a thin sheet of about a 1/4 to 1/6 inch thickness and use a pizza cutter or a knife to cut the dough into tiny pieces as shown in the video above</li>
   <li>Preheat some oil - enough to deep fry the chin chin and fry until golden brown.</li>
   <li>Allow to cool completely before serving. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
