   <h4> Instructions</h4>
   <ol>
      <h4>To make the dough</h4>
      <li>Rub together till all turn to crumbs</li>
      <li>Add 100 ml of water and mix till all is combined. If the dough still needs water add a tablespoon of water at a time till you get well combined dough </li>
      <li>Set dough aside in a cool place or a fridge for 30 minutes then you move on to preparing the meaty filling.</li>
      <li>Yes! Making the dough is that easy but remember, DO NOT overwork it when handling.</li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <h4>To make the  pie filling</h4>
    <li>Place a pan on medium heat and add oil, heat for 2 minutes, add chopped onions and fry till onion is translucent. Add mince to the onion and stir mince till its brown then add curry powder, thyme, stock cube, a pinch of salt and stir till all combine. Reduce the heat if need be to avoid burning.</li>
    <li>The fat from the mince should make the sauce juicy but if it looks dry, add 4 water to it. (decant oil if it is too much)</li>
    <li>Add boiled potatoes and carrots, combine well and cook on a low heat for another 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>The mince should be well cooked now. Now you move on to thickening the mince.</li>
    <li>Add 2tbsp of flour to a bowl and mix with water to form a paste. Add the paste to the mince meat on the heat and combine well. Leave to cook for another minute. Take off the heat and allow to cool.</li>
    
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <h4>Rolling the dough and making the meat pie</h4>
    <li>Preheat oven at 180C/350F</li>
    <li>Crack the egg into a bowl, whisk and set aside</li>
    <li>Sprinkle a bit of flour on a plain, clean surface/worktop</li>
    <li>Divide dough into 2 or 3 places and roll out flat using a rolling pin(should be 0.5 -1 cm thick)</li>
    <li>Place a circle cutter on the flat dough and cut out into many circles you can get. use a makeshift if you don’t have a cutter. Repeat this process with the rest of the dough</li>
    <li>Add the meat filling to the centre of the circled dough, brush one half of the circle with whisked egg and carefully fold over the meat filling making sure the 2 edges touch one another. The aim of the egg is to seal the dough.</li>
    <li>Close edges by pressing down with the tip of a fork</li>
    <li>Repeat this process for the remaining dough and filling.</li>
    <li>set on a baking tray, egg wash the surface of the pasteries and poke through with a fork</li>
    <li>Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes at 180C⁰/350F.</li>
