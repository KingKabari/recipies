    <li>Place a small pan on medium heat, add palm oil and heat for about 2 minutes. Add chopped onions and fry till onions are translucent. Take it off the heat and set aside. This is to be added to the yam at the tail end of the cooking.
    <li>Once yam is almost tender add already heated palm oil to the yam and continue to cook till yam is tender. Using a back of a wooden ladle, break yam into pieces but not to puree, leave some yam chunks if you desire</li>
