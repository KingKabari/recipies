    <h3><i>From the Igbo language of southeastern Nigeria we get the vegetableâ€™s English name, as okwuru became ochra and okra. Along the entire length of the 3,500 mile coast exploited by the trans-Atlantic slave trade, okra was grown and cooked with other vegetables or rice and made into soup.</i> </h3>
