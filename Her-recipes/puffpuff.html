    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
       <li>2 cups flour</li> 
       <li>1¼ cups water</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons yeast</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
       <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>¼ cup sugar + 1 teaspoon sugar for proofing the yeast</li>
       <li>oil</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>  Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
<li>Mix half of a cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast in a bowl. Cover with a lid and set aside until the yeast becomes bubbly. About 4-6 minutes.</li>
<li>In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients – Flour, Sugar, Salt, and Nutmeg.</li>
<li>Pour the proofed yeast and the remainng one cup water together with the dry ingredients and mix until the batter is lump-free.</li>
<li>Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 1 hour. (The risen dough has a distinct sweet smell, which will make you know the dough is ready for frying)</li>
<li>Preheat the oil in a pan deep and wide enough to accomodate the puff puff balls (about 360°F ) and scoop a little bit of dough and drop the batter by spoonfuls into the oil.</li>
<li>Fry both sides until golden brown. If you are finding it hard to turn the puff puff while frying you can just press down the balls a little bit with your frying spoon before turning it.</li>
<li>Remove from heat. Drain on a paper towel and enjoy while still hot or warm.</li>
<li>sprinkle with sugar and serve</li>
</ol>
